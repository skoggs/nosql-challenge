# nosql-challenge
A program that uses MongoDB to read, edit, and query a large restaurant data set.

##How to use
To replicate the results in these programs, you will need to load "establishments.json", included as a ZIP file in the Resources folder, into MongoDB. Thus, knowledge of MongoDB is presumed if trying to run these.

## Function
This repository is split into two main separate files. Both are in Jupyter Notebook format, so the steps and output can be followed with ease. 

The NoSQL_setup_starter file sets up the MongoDB collection, makes some alterations to it, and runs a few queries to confirm its function. 

The NoSQL_analysis_starter takes things a step further and makes a number of much more advanced queries into the same data. Output is also read out via pprint and saved into DataFrames.
